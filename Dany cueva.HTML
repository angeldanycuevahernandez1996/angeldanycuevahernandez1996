  <h2 class='destination'>1. Montreal, Canada</h2>
  <div class='description'>Montreal is the second most populous city in Canada and the most populous city in the province of Quebec. 
    Founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie, or "City of Mary",[15] it is named after Mount Royal,[16] the triple-peaked hill around which the early city of Ville-Marie is built.[17] The city is centred on the Island of Montreal, which obtained its name from the same origin as the city,[18][19] and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. 
    The city is 196 km (122 mi) east of the national capital Ottawa, and 258 km (160 mi) southwest of the provincial capital, Quebec City.

  <h2 class='destination'>2. Fukuoka, Japon</h2>
  <div class='description'>Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan, the second-largest port city after Yokohama, and the capital city of Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. 
    The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. 
    Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo), 
    Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present.
